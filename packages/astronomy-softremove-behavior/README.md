# Soft remove behavior for Meteor Astronomy

Forked from https://github.com/jagi/meteor-astronomy-softremove-behavior

The soft remove behavior let's you remove a document without deleting it from the collection. Instead it's marked as removed. Removed documents can be excluded from displaying in a template.

A detailed information about behavior can be found [here](http://jagi.github.io/meteor-astronomy/v2#softremove).
